  <article><h2>AERIAL DANCE</h2> 
       <p>Aerial Modern Dance is a subgenre of modern dance first recognized in the United States in the <strong>1970'S</strong>. The choreography incorporates an apparatus often attached to the ceiling, allowing performers to explore space in three-dimensions. The ability to incorporate vertical, as well as horizontal movement paths, allows for innovations in choreography and movement vocabulary</p>

       <h2>TYPES OF AERIAL DANCE</h2>
      <p><strong>Aerial silk</strong> is one of the most well-recognized aspects of this type of dance, and is often called aerial ribbon, fabric, or tissue depending on region. Performers climb the special fabric without safety lines, simply because the silk acts as their safety net. Artists wrap themselves in a certain way that can secure their limbs so that they will not fall. Some choose to use dried or sprayed rosin on their hands and feet to increase the grip and friction on the fabric, but with proper training, safety is not hard to come by.</li>
      <li>A <strong>trapeze</strong> is a short horizontal bar hung by ropes or metal straps from a support. There are different types of trapeze performances, such as static, swinging or flying, and it can be peformed solo or with multiple people involved.</li>
        <li>Also known as the "aerial hoop," the <strong>lyra</strong> is a type of equipment that never fails to impress an audience! It is typically made from steel or aluminum and hangs from a high height on the ceiling, and can be used statically, swinging, or spinning.</p>
